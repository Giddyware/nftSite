                2.1. Ownership and Authenticity: As a seller on Artmint, it is
                imperative that you have the legal rights to sell the NFTs you
                list on the platform. By listing an NFT for sale, you represent
                and warrant that you are the rightful owner of the NFT and have
                the authority to transfer ownership to the buyer. Artmint may
                require you to undergo an insurance verification process to
                confirm your ownership rights and to provide a level of
                assurance to potential buyers.
                <span>
                  Additionally, in certain cases, Artmint may collect a
                  refundable fee from the seller to further ensure the
                  authenticity and legitimacy of the NFT. This fee will be
                  refunded to the seller upon successful completion of the
                  transaction and verification of ownership.
                </span>{" "}
                It is your responsibility to ensure that the NFTs you list are
                accurately described and that the images and information
                provided reflect the actual item for sale.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.2. Prohibited Content: Artmint strictly prohibits the listing
                or trading of NFTs that are illegal, fraudulent, offensive,
                infringe on intellectual property rights, or violate these Terms
                and Conditions. You may not list NFTs that contain explicit or
                adult content, promote hate speech, or engage in any form of
                illegal activity. Artmint reserves the right to remove any
                content that violates these guidelines and may take appropriate
                action, including suspending or terminating the accounts of
                users who repeatedly violate these rules.

                buyers and sellers, Artmint encourages users to resolve such
                issues amicably. Artmint does not act as an arbiter in these
                disputes and is not responsible for mediating or resolving them.
                The resolution of disputes, including refunds or returns of
                NFTs, is at the discretion of the seller unless otherwise
                required by applicable laws or regulations. It is recommended
                that buyers and sellers communicate openly and honestly to
                address any concerns or discrepancies that may arise during the
                transaction process.
